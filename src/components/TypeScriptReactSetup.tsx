import React from "react";

export const Setup = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <div style={{fontSize: 20, }}>
                To set up an environment for <em>React</em> and <em>Typescript</em>, 
                I followed <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/">this setup</a>.
            </div>
            <div>
                In this way you get a setup ready to work on. It also includes a test library that I will not cover in debts now.
            </div>
            <div>You will probably get a warning like this:</div>
            <div></div>
        </div>
    )
}
